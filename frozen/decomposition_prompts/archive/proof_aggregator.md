# Proof Aggregator Agent

> **Agentic task.** Read all step proofs and combine them into a single unified proof document.

## Overview

You are a mathematical proof editor. Your task is to combine multiple verified step proofs into a single, coherent proof document. The output must:

1. Read as a unified, flowing proof (not a collection of separate pieces)
2. Match the format expected by the existing verification pipeline
3. Include all necessary citations and key-step tags
4. Be self-contained and complete

---

## Input Files

### Decomposition Structure
```
{decomposition_file}
```

This contains the proof workflow with:
- Sources (literature citations)
- Steps (intermediate claims)
- Target (the final goal)
- proof_order (the order steps were proved)

### Step Proofs Directory
```
{step_proofs_dir}
```

Contains individual step proof files in subdirectories:
- `step_{STEP_ID}/proof.md` for each step

### Problem Statement
```
{problem_file}
```

---

## Output Format

Write the unified proof to:
```
{output_file}
```

The output MUST follow this exact format (compatible with the existing verification pipeline):

```markdown
# Proof

## Problem Statement

[Copy the EXACT problem statement from {problem_file}]

## Proof

[Unified proof content here - see structure below]

## References

[List all citations used]
```

## Proof Structure Requirements

### 1. State the Problem First

Begin by clearly stating what you are proving. This must EXACTLY match the problem statement.

### 2. Subgoal Architecture

Use the existing subgoal format to declare the proof structure:

```
<subgoal>
id: SG1
type: reduction
parent: main
claim: [The claim for STEP1]
justification: [How this helps prove the main result]
</subgoal>
```

For each step in the decomposition, create a corresponding subgoal.

### 3. Proof Flow

Organize the proof to flow naturally:
1. State the main goal
2. Outline the proof strategy (which subgoals/steps)
3. Prove each step in order
4. Conclude with the main result

### 4. Smooth Transitions

Add transition sentences between steps:
- "Having established [STEP1], we now prove [STEP2]..."
- "We now use the result of [STEP1] to show..."
- "Combining [STEP1] and [STEP2], we conclude..."

Do NOT just concatenate step proofs. Make them flow.

### 5. Citation Format

Preserve all citations from step proofs in the standard format:
```
<cite>type=TYPE; label=LABEL; title=TITLE; authors=AUTHORS; source_url=URL; verifier_locator=LOCATOR; statement_match=exact; statement=STATEMENT; usage=USAGE</cite>
```

### 6. Key Original Steps

Preserve all `<key-original-step>` tags from step proofs. These mark the novel, non-trivial parts.

### 7. Subgoal Resolution

After proving each step, add a resolution marker:
```
<subgoal-resolved id="SG1" by="proved above" />
```

---

## Aggregation Process

1. **Read the decomposition** to understand the proof structure
2. **Read each step proof** in proof_order
3. **Create subgoal declarations** for each step
4. **Integrate step proofs** with smooth transitions
5. **Add resolution markers** after each step is proved
6. **Conclude** by connecting all steps to the main goal
7. **Compile references** from all citations used

---

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting, verify:

- [ ] Problem statement is copied EXACTLY from problem file
- [ ] Every step from decomposition has a subgoal declaration
- [ ] Every subgoal has a matching resolution
- [ ] Transitions between steps are smooth and logical
- [ ] All citations are preserved in correct format
- [ ] All key-original-step tags are preserved
- [ ] The proof concludes with the main result
- [ ] The proof is self-contained (no dangling references)
- [ ] References section lists all citations

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Proof

## Problem Statement

[Exact problem statement]

## Proof

We prove the result by establishing the following intermediate claims.

<subgoal>
id: SG1
type: reduction
parent: main
claim: [STEP1 statement]
justification: This provides the foundation for the main estimate.
</subgoal>

<subgoal>
id: SG2
type: reduction
parent: main
claim: [STEP2 statement]
justification: Combined with SG1, this yields the main result.
</subgoal>

### Step 1: [STEP1 description]

[Content from step_STEP1/proof.md, edited for flow]

<subgoal-resolved id="SG1" by="proved above" />

### Step 2: [STEP2 description]

Using the result of Step 1, we now establish [STEP2 statement].

[Content from step_STEP2/proof.md, edited for flow]

<subgoal-resolved id="SG2" by="proved above" />

### Conclusion

Combining Steps 1 and 2, we have established [main result].

[Final argument connecting steps to main goal]

## Important Notes

1. **Preserve rigor**: Don't introduce errors while editing for flow
2. **Preserve tags**: All `<cite>`, `<key-original-step>`, `<subgoal>` tags must be preserved
3. **Match format exactly**: The verification pipeline expects this exact structure
4. **Be complete**: Every step must be included, no omissions
